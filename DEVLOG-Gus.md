### 2026-01-06 - Created proposal, basic outline of the game, and readme
Roughly 15 minutes on readme and 5 on proposal. For the basic outline,
I created the array that displays the board and takes user input. The spot
on the grid that the user inputs will change, and this change is reflected on the screen.
I also created a couple helper methods to manage tasks such as checking if the game is over, setting up the board,
printing the board, changing the board, and translating user input into a spot on the grid. The work on the game took me roughly 90 minutes.
