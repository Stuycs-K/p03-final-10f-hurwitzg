# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Gus Hurwitz

# Intentions:

2-Player tic-tac-toe

# Intended usage:

The user will be randomly assigned either X or O and wait for another player to join. Once connected,
the user will input either A, B, or C, and 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to a spot on the board. Once someone gets three in a row
or the whole board is full, the game will end.

# Technical Details:

I will be using sockets and networking to link the two players,
file reading and writing to track all-time stats for eahc player,
processes to manage multiple games being played at the same time, and 
allocating memory to create arrays, strings, write to files, and all other
memory-allocation tasks. I am responsible for all parts because I am working solo.


# Intended pacing:

By thursday: tic tac toe works
By monday: server is set up and is now a functional game
By tuesday: users will create a username and password, and their stats will be tracked in a csv file
By wednesday: users will have the option to play again after each game. This will reconnect them with the previous
              user if both play again, or a new user if only one does
By thursday: simple messaging
By friday: Everything done
